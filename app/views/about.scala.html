<h1>About</h1>
<p>
	My name is Ivan Meredith and I am a software developer living in Cambridge, New Zealand. I currently am working for <a href="http://cloudbees.com">CloudBees</a> as an engineer on DEV@@cloud.
</p>
<p>
	This site was created so that I can learn more about making websites. I usually work on more backend code, so this is a chance to create something visually, as well as play around with different coding techniques. I also hope to regularly blog about some of the things I am working on for work, as well as other cool things. It is built with Play 2.0 and is running on the CloudBees RUN@@cloud platform. The code for this site can be found on <a href="http://github.com/hadashi/nomspace">github</a>.

<h3>Personal interests</h3>
<p>I have been interesting in learning Japanese for quite a few years. I have been on an off learning it for the last 3 years.<p>
